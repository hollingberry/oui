NAME
       oui − lookup MAC address prefixes

SYNOPSIS
       oui [−D] ADDRESS

DESCRIPTION
       The  oui  utility  provides  an  easy  way to lookup OUIs and other MAC
       address prefixes using the official IEEE OUI database.

       The ADDRESS must be at least three octets and  either  colon‐delimited,
       dash−delimited,  or  period−delimited.  It  attempts to expand one−byte
       sequences into  two−byte  sequences  so  that,  for  instance,  b5:d:d1
       becomes b5:0d:d1.

       When  you first run oui, it will try to download the IEEE OUI database,
       which requires Internet connectivity and can take quite a  while.  How‐
       ever, once the database is downloaded, oui will run quickly and without
       Internet.

OPTIONS
       −D     Force oui to redownload the IEEE database.

BUGS
       oui does not support reverse lookups by manufacturer name.
